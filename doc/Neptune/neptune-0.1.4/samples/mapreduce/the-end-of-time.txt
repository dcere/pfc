1 FX SHOT - PLANET EARTH 1

FX: THE EARTH, suspended in space, in all its beauty.

Over this, the NARRATOR.  An old, wise man.

NARRATOR

It is said that in the final days

of Planet Earth, everyone had bad

dreams.

MIX TO:

2 EXT. SHOPPING STREET - NIGHT 1 2

CAMERA craning down a huge, outdoor CHRISTMAS TREE...

NARRATOR

To the west of the north of that

world, the Human Race did gather,

in celebration of a pagan rite, to

banish the cold and the dark.

craning down to find a SALVATION ARMY BRASS BAND.  God...

Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen; the most mournful of carols.

Moving round to find a few ONLOOKERS (SHOPPERS in b/g). 

People, just dotted about, pausing.  A woman & gran.  Three

teenagers.  A family, mum, dad and little daughter...

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

Each and every one of those people

had dreamt of the terrible things

to come.  But they forgot, because

they must; they forgot their

nightmares, of fire and war and

insanity.  They forgot...

.then finding WILFRED MOTT...

NARRATOR (CONT'D)

Except for one.

Wilf's troubled, uneasy, and on his CLOSE UP -

INTERCUT, fast, violent - CU of a FACE, bleached, against

black - manic laughter - a familiar face, it's -

Wilf blinks.  Shakes it off.  Turns away... 

CUT TO WIDER.  Wilf wandering along.  Lost in thought.

And then he hears... 

Evensong.  Beautiful, high chords.  He looks...

A CHURCH.  In the middle of town.  (The Runaway Bride

church.)  It's as though the music is drawing him in...

CUT TO:

3 INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 1 3

WILDRED enters.  The vaulted space filled with Evensong.

A CHOIR, at the altar, dressed in full surplices.

Candles all around.  The pews are almost empty, just one

or two PEOPLE, dotted about, in prayer.

Wilf looks round.  Not sure what he's doing there.

Then something catches his eye...

To the side, a STAINED GLASS WINDOW.

He walks closer.  Something in the image...

At the bottom of the window, to the left: a BLUE BOX.  

FX: image inlaid, a simple representation of the Tardis,

stained-glass panels of light radiating from its lamp.

The Evensong drifts into The Doctor's Theme, as Wilf walks

closer.  Staring, entranced, then -

WOMAN

They call it the Legend of the

Blue Box.

He turns.  The WOMAN behind him.  She's 60, wise, kind.

WILF

Never been in here before.  I'm

not one for churches.  Too cold.

WOMAN

This was the site of a convent,

back in the thirteen hundreds. 

It's said a demon fell from the

sky.  Then a man appeared, a man

in a blue box.  They called him

the sainted physician.  He smote

the demon.  And then disappeared.

WILF

Bit of a coincidence.

WOMAN

In what way?

WILF

(looks back at window)

I've, just, heard stories like...

that before, that's all.

(CONTINUED)

WOMAN

It's said there's no such thing as

coincidence.  Who knows?  Perhaps

he's coming back.

WILF

Ohh, that would make my Christmas -

He turns back round -

No one there.  The woman has gone; like she was never there.

Wilf chilled.  He looks back at the stained-glass window.

The choir's voices soaring now.

CLOSER on the glass blue box...

CLOSER on Wilf, CLOSER on the box, now INTERCUT WITH -

The FACE - the insane, laughing face -

The face of THE MASTER.

CUT TO:

4 EXT. ICE PLAIN - DAY 4

FX: WIDE SHOT, ICESCAPE, as 4.3, the Planet of the Ood.

FX: CLOSER, THE TARDIS MATERIALISES in an icy quarry. 

Rain in the air, washing away some of the snow.

THE DOCTOR pops his head out.  Big, deliberate grin.  He's

in sunglasses, wearing a flowery Hawaiian lei & straw hat.

THE DOCTOR

Ah!  Not so frosty any more, what's

this?  Springtime on the Ood-Sphere? 

New life, fresh start, all of that.

This directed at, a good distance away: OOD SIGMA.

The Doctor strolls towards him.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

So, where were we?  I was summoned,

wasn't I?  An Ood, in the snow,

calling to me, weeeeell, I didn't

exactly come straight here.  Had a

bit of fun, y'know?  Travelled

about.  Did this and that.  Got

into trouble, you know me.  It was

brilliant, I saw the Phosphorous

Carousel of the Great Magellan

Gestadt.  Saved a planet from the

Red Carnivorous Maw.  Named a galaxy

Alison.

OOD SIGMA

You should not have delayed.

THE DOCTOR

(takes off the hat)

The last time I was here, you said

my song would be ending soon.  And

I'm in no hurry for that. 

OOD SIGMA

You will come with me.

Ood Sigma starts to walk away.

THE DOCTOR

Hold on, better lock the Tardis -

He lifts his key, clicks it.

FX: the Tardis lamp flashes twice, with a chirp-chirp,

like a car alarm, the clunk of locks.

Ood Sigma doesn't look back, just keeps on walking.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

D'you see?  Like a car?  I locked

it, like a car, like it's funny. 

No?  Funny?  Just a little bit?

(sighs, follows)

Blimey, try to make an Ood laugh...

CUT TO:

5 EXT. ICE PLAIN #2 - DAY 5

OOD SIGMA walking ahead, reaching the top of an incline. 

Stops.  THE DOCTOR following (now carrying hat & lei) -

THE DOCTOR

so how old are you now, Ood...

Sigma?  How long's it been, since

I was here with Donna? 

He reaches the top, stops.  Looks out.  Amazed.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Ah.  Quite a while, then.

FX: his POV, DMP, the OOD CITY.  Like Petra, but made of

ice, built into a cliff face.  Simple dwellings, doorways

set within the ice; distant OOD inlaid, walking about.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Magnificent.  Oh come on!  That

is... splendid!  You've achieved

all this?!  In how long?

OOD SIGMA

One hundred years.

THE DOCTOR

Then we've got a problem.  Cos all

of this is way too fast.  Not just

the city, I mean your ability to

call me, reaching all the way back

to the 21st Century.  Something is

accelerating your species, way

beyond normal.

OOD SIGMA

And the Mind of the Ood is troubled.

THE DOCTOR

Why, what's happened?

OOD SIGMA

Every night, Doctor.  Every night,

we have bad dreams.

CUT TO:

5A EXT. ICE PLAIN #2 - DAY 5A

OOD SIGMA leading THE DOCTOR towards the mouth of a CAVE.

CUT TO:

6 INT. ICE CAVE - DAY 6

CU on the ELDER OOD.  Its face is aged, its skull more

brain-like.  Swathed in white robes.  It holds its HINDBRAIN in one hand, the other hand scooping SMOKE from the

small FIRE in front of it, like it's breathing incense. 

Its muttering voice is whispery, more Human than Sigma's:

ELDER OOD

returning, returning, it is...

slowly returning, through the dark

and the fire and the blood, always

returning, returning to this world..

FX: WIDER, DMP, glinting rocks of the ICE CAVE above (not

part of the city, more of a Holy Man's retreat).  A circle

of NATURAL OOD sit around the fire; they wear simple grey

robes, now, not as impoverished. 

ELDER OOD (CONT'D)

it is returning and he is...

returning and they are returning,

but too late, too late, far too

late, he is come...

All look up, turn their heads...

THE DOCTOR (now with hat, lei & sunglasses just in his

hand) and OOD SIGMA arriving.

6 CONTINUED: (2) 6

There's a space for the Doctor, opposite the Elder.  He

sits.  Ood Sigma standing, forever on duty, to the side.

THE DOCTOR

So.  Right.  Hello. 

ELDER OOD

You will join, you will join, you

will join, you will join...

As he repeats that, the Elder & Ood put their hind-brains

in their laps; all join hands, the Ood either side of the

Doctor joining hands with him (Ood hands, no more gloves).

The Doctor cautious... but reaches out, takes their hands -

CU the Doctor - shocked, fear!  INTERCUT WITH -

THE MASTER'S FACE.  His giggling insanity -

The Doctor lets go -

The Elder Ood calmer, more focused now.

ELDER OOD (CONT'D)

He comes to us.  Every night.  I

think all the peoples of the

universe dream of him, now.

THE DOCTOR

That man is dead.

ELDER OOD

There is yet more.  Join us.

Deep breath.  The Doctor takes hold of their hands again.

The Doctor concentrates.  All of this with eyes open; he's

staring to the distance, sharing these visions.

ELDER OOD (CONT'D)

Events are taking shape.  So many

years ago, and yet changing the

now.  There is a man.  So scared. 

CU Doctor, CU Elder, INTERCUT WITH -

CUT TO:

7 INT. NOBLES' KITCHEN - NIGHT 2 7

CU WILF, alone, staring into space, fearful.

THE DOCTOR

Wilfred... Is he all right?  What

about Donna, is she safe?

ELDER OOD

You should not have delayed.  For

the lines of convergence are being

drawn across the Earth, even now. 

The king is in his counting house...

CUT TO:

9 INT. NAISMITH'S STUDY - DAY 2 9

Formal positions, facing camera: JOSHUA NAISMITH, the

father; 50, a businessman, powerful, almost regal.  And

his daughter, ABIGAIL, 20, rich and spoilt.  B/g: a stately

home's study, sparse, with classy Christmas decorations.

REVERSE: beside the PHOTOGRAPHER, Naismith's valet/butler,

MR DANES, supervising.  He's 28, cool, handsome, cruel.

Flash!  Flash!  Their photo being taken, intercut with the

Doctor & Ood, JUMP-CUTTING into CUs of each Naismith -

CUT TO:

10 INT. ICE CAVE - DAY 10

THE DOCTOR

.I don't know who they are...

Flash!  The Naismith photo printed as a Christmas card -

ELDER OOD

And there is another.  The most

lonely of all, lost and forgotten...

CUT TO:

11 INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT 2 11

CU on a woman, sitting on her thin bed.  Alone.  Crying. 

She looks up at the moonlight, through the barred window.

This is LUCY SAXON.

THE DOCTOR seeing -

THE DOCTOR

12 CONTINUED: 12

INTERCUT WITH CONTINUATION OF SC.11.  WIDER on Lucy, seeing

her through the hatch in the metal door.  Which slams shut.

OOD SIGMA

We see so much, but understand

little.  The woman in the cage,

who is she?

THE DOCTOR

She was...  It wasn't her fault,

she was...  The Master, he's a

Time Lord, like me, but...

(realises)

I can show you.

He lifts his hands a little.  Concentrates, staring... 

And now they see what he's seeing.  More in control:

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

The Master took the name of Saxon. 

He married a human, a woman called

Lucy.  And he corrupted her.  She

stood at his side while he conquered

the Earth.  I reversed everything

he'd done, so it never even

happened... but Lucy Saxon

remembered.  And she killed him. 

I held him in my arms.  I burnt

his body.  The Master is dead.

All INTERCUT, fast, the Doctor & the Ood seeing - images 

from Series 3 ep.12 sc.7, Lucy & the Master facing the

press, in victory, 12.16, reacting to Vivien Rook's death,

12.51, together on the airstrip, 12.69, Lucy's insane dance,

13.6, her black eye, 13.80, the Master shot, Lucy holding

the gun, the Master dying, 13.81, the funeral pyre...

ELDER OOD

And yet, you did not see...

13.91A, the Master's ring falls from the pyre.

THE DOCTOR

What's that - ?

A hand picks it up...

CUT TO:

13 EXT. NIGHT SKY BACKGROUND - NIGHT X 13

New continuation of 13.91A.  No need for the pyre, only

reflected firelight & night sky; CU of a woman, holding

the ring.  Red fingernails.  MISS TREFUSIS; 50, stern.

CU on the ring.  The Gallifreyan symbols.

CUT TO:

14 INT. ICE CAVE - DAY 14

THE DOCTOR, horrified.

THE DOCTOR

Part of him survived...

(goes to stand)

I have to go -

But the Ood hold on tight -

ELDER OOD

But something more is happening,

Doctor.  The Master is part of a

greater design.  Because a shadow

is falling over creation; something

vast is stirring in the dark. 

And the Doctor looks round the circle, horrified...

All the Ood-eyes are now RED!

ELDER OOD (CONT'D)

The Ood have gained this power, to

see through Time, because Time is

bleeding.  Shapes of things once

lost are moving through the veil. 

And these events from years ago

threaten to destroy this future. 

And the present.  And the past.

THE DOCTOR

?what do you mean...

ELDER OOD

This is what we have seen, Doctor. 

The darkness heralds only one thing -

ALL OOD

The End of Time itself.

The Doctor lets go - !

All hands let go, shocked -

The Ood-eyes now normal again.

The Doctor so scared, staring...

Then he scrabbles to his feet - running - !

CUT TO:

15 EXT. ICE PLAIN #2 - DAY 15

THE DOCTOR, running for his life -

ELDER OOD

Events that have happened, are

happening now.

CUT TO:

17 INT. PRISON CELL & CORRIDOR - NIGHT 2 17

RED FINGERNAILS - a hand, turning keys in a lock -

The CELL DOOR swings open.  LUCY looks up, surprised.

MISS TREFUSIS in the doorway.  The senior prison guard.

CUT TO:

18 EXT. ICE PLAIN #2 - DAY 18

CU on the Doctor, desperate - running, running, running -

CUT TO:

19 INT. PRISON CELL & CORRIDOR - NIGHT 2 19

LUCY steps into the corridor.  To find MISS TREFUSIS with

a whole phalanx of 6 FEMALE GUARDS, all grim, like soldiers.

Lucy scared, no idea what's going on.  But she's cowed and

crushed now, has been for years.  She's just timid, falls

into line.  Miss Trefusis & BLONDE GUARD lead the way,

then Lucy, then the others.  Like they're going to war.

CUT TO:

20 EXT. ICE PLAIN - DAY 20

THE DOCTOR runs - there's the Tardis - presses his key

while running, chirp-chirp - he slams inside -

24 INT. PRISON DUNGEON - NIGHT 2 24

A rusty metal door creaks open.

MISS TREFUSIS & BLONDE GUARD lead LUCY down a dark

staircase, other GUARDS following; an abandoned part of

the prison.  Stairs lead down to a dungeon, a dark basement. 

Big, wide floorspace, falling into shadow around the edges. 

Lit by candles, a plinth at the centre.  Waiting for her:

THE GOVERNOR.  40, imperious, brisk, in her element.

GOVERNOR

Mrs Saxon.  Let me introduce myself. 

I'm your new Governor.  I'm afraid

the previous Governor met with

something of an accident.  Which

took quite some time to arrange.

LUCY

what am I doing here?  What do...

you want?

GOVERNOR

Put her in position.

The BLONDE GUARD leads Lucy to stand opposite the plinth.

GOVERNOR (CONT'D)

Miss Trefusis.  If you will prepare.

Miss Trefusis goes to the shadows, picks up a CLAY BOWL. 

Places it on the plinth.  At the same time, 4 Guards go to

the corners, find a SMALL URN each - crude, ancient pottery -

then take positions with the others, in a circle around

the plinth (a good distance away from it).  During this:

GOVERNOR (CONT'D)

You've kept your silence well, Mrs

Saxon.  Your trial was held in

secret, with no jury.  So no one

knows who Harold Saxon was.  Where

he came from.  Why you killed him.  

LUCY

I just want to be left alone.  I

deserve my punishment.  That's all

there is to be said.

GOVERNOR

Make her kneel.

The Blonde Guard has stayed standing behind Lucy throughout,

now shoves her forward, Lucy stumbling, to kneel.

GOVERNOR (CONT'D)

There are those of us who never

lost faith.

GOVERNOR (CONT'D)

And in his wisdom, Mr Saxon prepared

for this moment.  He saw that he

might die.  And made us ready. 

Miss Trefusis?

Miss Trefusis takes something from her pocket... 

GOVERNOR (CONT'D)

Tonight, Mrs Saxon.  He returns.

Miss Trefusis holds up: the Master's GALLIFREYAN RING.

CUT TO:

25 EXT. PRISON - NIGHT 2 25

CU SIGN on the outside wall, saying: HMP BROADFELL,

illuminated by a flash of PRAC LIGHT - lightning!

FX: LOW ANGLE on the forbidding PRISON.  STORM CLOUDS above,

CRACK OF LIGHTNING in the sky.

CUT TO:

26 INT. NOBLES' KITCHEN - NIGHT 2 26

WILF, all alone, hears the thunder, goes to the window...

FX: far-off, over the rooftops, LIGHTNING slamming down.

Wilf disturbed.  Feeling events drawing closer...

Behind him - Wilf not seeing - the TELEVISION flickers,

shashes, going from some stock footage to a glimpse of -

THE WOMAN, from sc.3.  Against white.  Staring out.

CUT TO:

27 INT. PRISON DUNGEON - NIGHT 2 27

MISS TREFUSIS places the ring inside the clay bowl.

The 4 GUARDS with URNS stand beside her.  The first steps

forward, lifting up her urn, emptying it, solemnly...

Thick, opaque BLUE LIQUID pours into the bowl.  It begins

to BUBBLE AND SEETHE, SMOKE rising up...

GOVERNOR

As it was written, in the Secret

Books of Saxon.  These are the

Potions of Life.

LUCY

Listen to me.  Just listen.

LUCY (CONT'D)

Whatever he told you...  You've

got no idea what you're doing! 

You can't bring him back, you can't!

GOVERNOR

Miss Trefusis.  The catalyst.

B/g, the 4 Guards continue to empty their urns, the bowl

bubbling, smoking, as Miss Trefusis walks forward.  Towards

Lucy.  Lucy shrinking back (though staying where she is) -

LUCY

What are you doing?  Leave me alone! 

Don't.  Don't - !

Miss Trefusis leaning down...

In her hand, a simple, small square of tissue.  She places

it against Lucy's lips.  Gentle.  Like a kiss.

Then takes it away.  Walks back towards the bowl...

GOVERNOR

You were Saxon's wife.  You bore

his imprint.  That's all we needed,

the final biometrical signature.

Miss Trefusis holds up the tissue...

Lets it fall into the BUBBLING BOWL.

She stands back, as...

FX: the seething and bubbling reaches up into a VORTEX OF

SPINNING, FURIOUS LIGHT rising up to the roof...

might live!

She's exultant, kneels.  All the guards - including MISS

TREFUSIS, now part of the circle - kneel.

Governor & Guards hold their arms open, held low -

FX: fainter STREAMS OF PLASMA-LIKE LIGHT pour from the

Governor's torso, pouring out, and across...

FX: WIDE SHOT, STREAMS OF LIGHT pouring from the Governor

and all the GUARDS, pouring into the WHIRLWIND CENTRE -

Only Lucy & Blonde Guard (still behind Lucy) untouched -

LUCY

Don't you see?!  He lied to you! 

His name's not even Harold Saxon!

CU Governor (no FX), smiling, joyous -

GOVERNOR

And this was written also.  For

his name... is the Master.

Lucy looks up, horrified...

FX: in the central VORTEX OF LIGHT, A SHAPE, forming...

above the plinth, hovering, suspended in light...

FX: CLOSER, MID-SHOT on the shape as it resolves...

FX: into THE MASTER.  Naked, though his lower half is hidden

in the WHIRL OF LIGHT.  He's lifting his head, flexing his

arms back, as though stretching into the world...

THE MASTER

 .never.  never.  Never.  Never...

Never dying.  Never dying.  Never

dying!  Never dying!  NEVER DYING!

THE MASTER

Lucy.  Oh, sweet Lucy Saxon.  My

ever faithful.  Did the widow's

kiss bring me back to life?

LUCY

You're killing them.

FX: GOVERNOR & GUARDS either side; still kneeling, LIGHT

pouring from their torsos - but they're weaker now, eyes

closing, heads lolling, energy being drained from them.

FX: (and REPEAT), the Master within the light -

THE MASTER

Let them die.  Oh, let them! 

They're just the first!  The whole

stinking stupid Human disgrace can

fall into the pit, can't you hear

it Lucy??  The noise?  The drumming? 

Louder than ever before, the drums,

the drums, the never-ending drums,

ohhh I have missed them - !

But then...

Lucy Saxon stands.  Staring up at him.  Brave and clever.

LUCY

But no one knew you better than

me.  And I knew this would happen,

one day, I knew you'd come back. 

All this time, your disciples were

prepared... but so were we.

She turns to the Blonde Guard.  Who's on her side!  She

reaches into her pocket, hands Lucy something...

THE MASTER

?what are you doing...

LUCY

The Secret Books of Saxon spoke of

the Potions of Life.  And I was

never that bright, but... my family

had contacts.  People clever enough

to calculate the opposite.

She's holding a SMALL PHIAL OF AMBER LIQUID.  Uncorks it...

FX: THE MASTER now panicky, writhing, trapped in his LIGHT -

THE MASTER

Don't you dare.  I'm ordering you. 

Lucy!  You will obey me - !

LUCY

Till death do us part, Harry.

It hits him.  He stops dead, stunned.   

Wrong time of day! 

He looks down...

He's standing by a burnt, battered sign, on the ground. 

HMP BROADFELL.

He turns, looks round behind him...

FX: DMP WIDE SHOT, the PRISON.  Destroyed.  The high outer

walls have fallen, the building beyond a charred, gutted

ruin.  No flames, no smoke; it burnt out days ago.

ABIGAIL NAISMITH walking towards him.  Echoing footsteps.

NAISMITH

I think we might be in luck,

darling.  It's the footage from

Broadfell Prison.  The night it

NAISMITH & ABIGAIL studying the image.

ABIGAIL

Someone survived.  D'you think

CUT TO:

41 INT. THE GATE ROOM - DAY 3 41

MR DANES opens the doors, JOSHUA & ABIGAIL NAISMITH enter.

A huge, long, elegant room - all French windows, red velvet

curtains, busts on plinths, oil paintings; a stately home

with a gleaming SCI-FI LABORATORY built inside it.  COMPUTER

BANKS & TERMINALS; to one side, TWO GLASS-WALLED BOOTHS. 

TECHNICIANS at work.  FOUR ARMED GUARDS.  Minimal Christmas

decorations, just one, classy tree.  And at the far end...

THE IMMORTALITY GATE.

A huge, dark-metal, rectangular frame, bristling with

technology, as wide and as high as possible.  Three sides

to the frame, left, right and top, with the left and right

sides disappearing into the floor, ie, no bottom frame.

NAISMITH

Ladies and gentlemen.  It seems

help is at hand.  Christmas is

cancelled!  Prepare the Gate!

TOMMO (CONT'D)

Someone's lively on his feet.

THE MASTER

Starving.

And devours his burger, all at once, a mess.

Catching a scent...

CUT TO WASTELAND, far away from the Doctor - literally, a

mile or so away.  THE MASTER hunched.  He's got Tommo's

coat.  Is eating it.  When he catches a scent...

Looks up.  Alert.

Then he picks up a piece of metal.  Goes to an old oil

drum.  Hits it.

One!  Two!  Three!  Four!

CUT TO the Doctor.  So far away.  But hearing it, in the

distance.  One!  Two!  Three!  Four!

standing.  Looks beyond.

Another stretch of wasteland.  Nothing.  The Master gone.

WINSTON

OLIVER

Tall and thin, big brown coat!

She gives her mobile to Oliver -

Well.  Me too, one day.

Don't you dare.

WILF

I'll try not to.

But I was told.  He will knock

four times.  That was the prophecy. 

Knock four times, and then...

WILF

I thought... when I last saw you,

Doctor, you said your people can

change, like, your whole body...

THE DOCTOR

I can still die.  If I'm killed

before regeneration, then I'm dead.

(pause)

Even then.  Even if I change... 

It feels like dying.  Everything I

am, dies.  Some new man goes

sauntering away, and...  I'm dead.

Wilf now looking at him.  Then looking out of the window. 

Then looking at him.  Then out of the window.

Stop it.

WILF

But you're so clever!  Can't you

bring her memory back?  Just go to

her now, go on, just run across

If she ever remembers me, then her

mind will burn, and she will die.

Then a TRAFFIC WARDEN comes near Donna's car (on double

and the traffic warden scurries away, scared.

The Doctor & Wilf laugh.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

She's not changed.

WILF

And there he is... 

SHAUN walking towards Donna.  He's tall, 30s, a kind,

handsome man.  Laden down with food-shopping.  Quick kiss

hello, then they make a great palaver out of dividing the

shopping up, some in the boot, some on the back seat.

WILF (CONT'D)

Shaun Temple.  They're engaged. 

Getting married in the spring.

FX: WIDE SHOT & DMP; aiming both fists down, the CG Master

blasts ENERGY from his fists, using it like Dr Octopus

uses his metal arms, to arc up through the air, over the

top of a DMP ruined wall, out into the night -

The Doctor runs, scrambles, to follow him outside -

THE DOCTOR running out - wasteland beyond -

THE MASTER now standing on a high mound of rubble, a good

THE MASTER

All these years!  You thought I

was mad!  King of the wasteland! 

But something is calling me, Doctor,

what is it, what is it, what is

it, what is it???

SLAM!  A spotlight from the sky slams down on the Master!

WIND blasts across the wasteland, violent -

And from up above, two ARMED GUARDS, in black security

uniforms, ABSEIL DOWN, either side of the Master -

The Doctor battling the wind, staring up -

MASSIVE NOISE of a helicopter above!  Lights shining down!

Fast, in seconds, a Guard injects a metal hypo-device into

the Master's neck - he falls unconscious, held by the guard -

TWO MORE GUARDS appear, ground level, running across the

rubble - guns aimed at the Doctor - yelling 'Keep back!'

The Abseil Guards are hooking the unconscious Master on to

one Guard's harness, making him secure -

The Doctor running forward -

THE DOCTOR

Don't!  Don't - !

One ground-level guard opens fire, PRAC GUNFIRE -

PRAC SHOTS fire in front of the Doctor, stopping him -

And the Master & Abseil Guards are HAULED UP INTO THE SKY!

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Let him go - !

- not seeing TWO MORE GUARDS running up behind him -

Whack!  On the back of his head, with the butt of a rifle -

The Doctor falls to the ground -

The lights in the sky recede...

The Guards on the ground run, disappearing into the night.

The Doctor lying on the floor.  Unconscious.

The wind and noise die down, into silence.

Christmas morning, Slade on the radio, all opening presents!

DONNA

Now then, steady on, never too

early for a marguerita, that's

what I say!  I forgot to get lemons

so I used oranges instead, it's

all fruit, same difference -

SYLVIA

(opening a jumper)

Oh now that's lovely, look at that! 

Absolutely beautiful.  "Love from

Donna."  Did you keep the receipt?

DONNA

Yes I did.

(sits opposite Wilf)

Come on, Gramps, you've been a

right old misery since you got up. 

D'you like it, then?  The book?

WILF

Joshua Naismith.  What d'you get

me that for?

Odd little still moment; Donna looking to the distance.

DONNA

I dunno.  I saw it in the shop,

and...  Thought of you.  Felt like

the sort of thing you should have.

Snapped out of it by -

SYLVIA

Oh look at that, from Charlie

Morton, isn't that rude?!

She holds up a topless-man card, Sylvia & Donna hooting.

NAISMITH

You've my daughter to thank for

this, it's all her idea.  She heard

rumours of Harold Saxon.  His

SHAUN

Aye aye!  Here's your presents!  I

couldn't afford much, but not for

the recession tonight!  C'mere -

Wilf sits, watching.  A polite little salute.

And the sc.3 WOMAN appears.  Against white.  Staring out.

WOMAN

Events are moving, Wilfred.  Faster

than we thought.

WILF

?eh...

(to the kitchen)

Can you see that?

Donna just glances across, like the TV's normal.

DONNA

Frankly, I'd tell her Majesty,

it's time for trouser-suits.

WILF

But that's not...

Chat in kitchen b/g continues, oblivious.  Wilf staring:

WOMAN

Only you can see.  Only you stand

at the heart of coincidence.

WILF

Why, what have I done?

WOMAN

You're an old soldier, sir.  Except

you were too late.  The war was

won and passed you by.

WILF

I did my duty.

WOMAN

You never killed a man.

WILF

I didn't.  I did not, no.  But

don't say that like it's shameful.

CUT TO:

69 INT. WILF'S BEDROOM - DAY 4 69

Laughter from downstairs.  WILF alone.  And scared.

He opens the bottom drawer of a chest.  Reaches to the

back.  Something hidden under the clothes.  He pulls out...

An old, cardboard box.

Opens it.  Fearful.

Inside: an old SERVICE REVOLVER, World War II.

Wilf trembling.  Holds it in his hand.  The weight of it.

And then...

A tap, a stone at the window.

He hurries over, to look.

In the street: THE DOCTOR & THE TARDIS!  The Doctor (in

new shirt & tie) waving at him, desperate: come down here!

The TARDIS parked a good distance away from the house,

WILF (now with jacket on) running over - THE DOCTOR frantic -

THE DOCTOR

He's still on Earth, I can smell

him, but he's too far away -

WILF

- you can't park there, what if

Donna sees it?!

THE DOCTOR

- you're the only one, Wilf, the

That's the man!  I was shown him,

WILF

By the what?

THE DOCTOR

By the Ood.

WILF

What's the Ood?

They're just Ood.  But it's all

You will not talk to the visitor,

you will have only minimum eye

contact with the visitor, if the

visitor makes any unauthorised

movement, meaning so much as a

step to the left or to the right,

the visitor will be shot dead. 

Guards will assume visors to monitor

the visitor's natural state.

- as NAISMITH & ABIGAIL enter, then THE MASTER, now with

arms bound in a straitjacket, wearing a leather dog-collar,

held on a leash by MR DANES, escorted by the 2 ARMED GUARDS. 

Though the Master's polite; biding his time. 

All the Guards wear riot-shield helmets; they now lower

the visors, which are polarised, obscuring their faces -

On one guard, as he lowers the visor, and cut to -

FX: HIS POV, visor coming down to see the SKELETON MASTER.

NAISMITH

And if we could demonstrate...

TECHNICIANS, including ROSSITER & ADDAMS, press buttons.

But that's not from Earth.

up to COMPUTERS BANKS, standing in shadows & dust.

Rossiter & Addams losing all composure, panicky -

ROSSITER

Who the hell is he?  What if he

finds out??  An expert, they said,

what sort of expert, who is he?!

ADDAMS

I don't know!  According to the

records, Harold Saxon was Prime

Minister of this stupid country -

oh I'm choking in this thing, sorry -

She bares her wrist - a wristwatch, she presses the centre -

FX: ADDAMS SHIMMERS, reveals her true form -

A VINVOCCI.  (Vin-vochy.)  Spiky faces, like 4.X's

Bannakaffalatta.  Except green.  And tall.  Spiky hands

too, though clothes remain the same as their human form.

The terminal's screen is scrolling with green alien text.

NAISMITH

The Gate was found inside a

spaceship, buried at the foot of

Mount Snowdon.  It was moved to an

Institute known as Torchwood, but

when Torchwood fell... let's just

say, I acquired it.

THE MASTER

I like you.

Thank you.

You'd taste great.

Naismith steps away.

The Master eats, digging his hands in, ravenous, as -

NAISMITH

The device came equipped with its

own power supply, a Nuclear Bolt. 

Radiation levels are strictly

controlled -

He's indicating the TWO GLASS BOOTHS.  Signs above the

door: left one, LOCKED, right one, OPEN.  One TECHNICIAN

inside the LOCKED left one; as he turns to the door, to

leave, he just waits, as another TECHNICIAN enters the

of the feedback, 24 hours a day.

THE MASTER

Butter-basted skin, nice!

NAISMITH

yes, and the power feeds through...

to the Gate, where it encourages

some sort of cellular regeneration. 

He goes to MISS COLLINS, a technician, 21.

NAISMITH (CONT'D)

Miss Collins was our test subject. 

She carried some burns, as a result

of an accident when she was a child,

down her left side, if you could..?

She rolls up her left sleeve.  Normal skin, no scars.

NAISMITH (CONT'D)

The Gate mended her.  And I imagine

its properties might be of some

use to you, right now. 

THE MASTER

But what do you want it for?

NAISMITH

We calculate, that if this device

can be fully repaired, by your

good self... it can restore the

body, forever.  Hence its given

title.  The Immortality Gate. 

Because that's what I want!  Not

for me.  But for my daughter.  I

revolutionise the nature of money

itself.  With unemployment at record

levels, lending at a standstill,

and four more major banks on the

verge of collapse, this could be

our last chance - not just for

capitalism, but for civilisation

itself.  The details of the plan

are a closely guarded secret. 

Indeed, it's being said that many

of the details are known only to

President Obama himself.  And so

we wait, both in hope, and in fear. 

Praying that this new Christmas

message will lead the Human race

out of darkness.  And into the

light.

2 FX SHOT. GALLIFREY - DAY 2

FX: LONG FX SHOT, craning up to reveal the mountains of

Gallifrey, as Ep.3.12 sc.40.  But now transformed; the

mountains are burning, a landscape of flame.  The valley's

a pit of fire, cradling the hulks of broken spaceships. 

Keep craning up to see, beyond; the Citadel of the Time

Lords.  The glass dome now cracked and open.

high vaults of stone & metal.  But the roof is now broken,

and 2 TIME LORDS, the latter pair in ceremonial collars.

& Time Lords now following the curve, heading towards TWO

HUGE, CARVED DOORS, already open.  A Black Void beyond.

CUT TO:

4 INT. BLACK VOID 4

FX: OTHER SIDE OF THE HUGE DOORS, NARRATOR & 2 TIME LORDS

striding through.  The Time Lords stay by the doors, on

guard; lose them, and the doors, as the Narrator walks on.

FX: WIDE SHOT of the Black Void - like Superman's Krypton,

the courtroom/Phantom Zone scenes - deep black, starkly

lit from above.  Centre of the Void: a long table, with 5

TIME LORDS in robes (no collars) seated.

The Narrator - now designated THE LORD PRESIDENT - reaches

the table.  He puts down his staff, loosens his robes -

underneath, a battered, black flack-jacket; this man is a

warrior.  One hand is sheathed in a BLUE-METAL GAUNTLET. 

Amongst those seated; THE CHANCELLOR, male, 45, thin,

worried; THE PARTISAN, female, 50, calm, shrewd.

LORD PRESIDENT

What news of the Doctor?

CHANCELLOR

Disappeared, my Lord President. 

PARTISAN

But we know his intention.  He

still possesses the Moment.  And

At the far end of the table; THE VISIONARY.  Female, 50,

insane, swathed in more witch-like robes.  Her face covered

with henna tattoos.  She scribbles constantly on old

parchments with a quill-like pen, muttering (her voice

muttering always, a constant undercurrent throughout):

VISIONARY

ending, burning, falling, all...

of it falling, the black and pitch

and screaming fire, so burning...

CHANCELLOR

All her prophecies say the same. 

That this is the final hour.  That

Gallifrey falls; that we die, today.

VISIONARY

!ending ending ending ENDING...

Silence.  Then:

PARTISAN

Perhaps it's time.  This is only

the furthest edge of the Time War. 

But at its heart, millions die

every second.  Lost in bloodlust

and insanity.  With Time itself

then resurrecting them, to find

new ways of dying, over and over

again.  We have become a travesty

of life.  Isn't it better to end

it?  At last?

LORD PRESIDENT

Thank you for your opinion.

He lifts his GAUNTLET -

FX: it shines, with a METALLIC BLUE LIGHT -

FX: PARTISAN convulses, in pain, swirls away, into nothing.

LORD PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Now.  You were saying?

Silence.  All too scared.  Then, suddenly furious:

LORD PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

I will not die.  Do you hear me?!

A billion years of Time Lord history

riding on our backs, I will not

let this perish, I will not! 

The Chancellor's panicky, goes to the Visionary, takes a

scroll - she keeps scribbling - takes it to the President.

I'm sorry, it's rather difficult

Day.  Two children of Gallifrey. 

LORD PRESIDENT

Does it name them?

CHANCELLOR

It foresees them locked in their

final confrontation.  The Enmity

of Ages.  Which would suggest...

LORD PRESIDENT

The Doctor.  And the Master.

But one word keeps being repeated. 

One, constant word, my Lord.

Hush now.  Listen to your Master.

No, I don't think you understand. 

Everyone on this planet is me. 

And I'm not phoning you, so who

With Wilf tied up, the Master digs in his jacket pockets -

WILF

It's no one, it's nothing, it's

just one of those ring-back things -

THE MASTER

Oh, and look at this!  Good man!

Out of one pocket - the old SERVICE REVOLVER.  The Doctor

surprised!  But the Master just throws it away -

Gets out Wilf's mobile, reads the screen:

CUT TO NAISMITH'S STUDY, the Master covers the phone:

Ohh, it's such a very great mistake

He's got the mouth-strap ready, but...  Close, intimate:

THE MASTER (CONT'D)

But tell me.  Where's your Tardis?

THE DOCTOR

You could be so wonderful.

THE MASTER

Where is it?

THE DOCTOR

You're a genius, you're stone-cold

brilliant, you are, I swear, you

really are.  But you could be so

much more.  You could be beautiful. 

With a mind like that, we could

travel the stars.  It would be my

honour.  Because you don't need to

own the universe.  Just see it. 

To have the privilege of seeing

the whole of time and space...

that's ownership enough.

THE MASTER

would it stop, then?  The noise...

in my head?

THE DOCTOR

I can help.

THE MASTER

(scared)

I don't know what I'd be.  Without

that noise.

I wonder what I'd be, without you.

And he walks away from the Doctor.  But the moment isn't

broken; he's still quiet.  Bitter.  Wants to talk.  Hasn't

said this aloud for hundreds of years.

THE MASTER (CONT'D)

It began on Gallifrey.  As children. 

(pause)

Not that you'd call it childhood. 

Just a life of duty.  Eight years

old, I was taken for initiation. 

To stare into the Untempered Schism.

WILF

?what does that mean...

THE DOCTOR

It's a gap in the fabric of reality. 

You can see into the Time Vortex

itself.  And it hurts.

THE MASTER

They took me there.  In the dark. 

On the Eve of Cold Lamentation.  I

looked into Time, old man.  And I

heard it.  Calling to me.  The

drumbeat.  The never-ending drums...

Ohh but that's clever.  No, wait a

minute.  Yes.  Ohh, that's good!

What?  What is?

THE MASTER concentrating.  Breathes in, and...

He hears it.

A simple signal.  Tic-tic-tic-tic.  One-two-three-four.

Opens his eyes.  Whispers, exalted:

THE MASTER

There!  The sound is tangible. 

And getting closer.  Someone could

only have designed this.  But who..?

The CHANCELLOR approaches THE LORD PRESIDENT.

CHANCELLOR

The signal has been sent.  A simple

task of four beats.  Transmitted

back through time, and implanted

in the Master's mind, as a child.

LORD PRESIDENT

Then we have a link.  To where the

Master is, right now.

FX: the IMAGE of the EARTH appears above the table.

CHANCELLOR

But we're still trapped inside the

Timelock, sir.  The link is nothing

more than a thought.  An idea.

LORD PRESIDENT

Then we need something to make the

contact physical.  Something so

simple...

He looks at THE VISIONARY.

She's staring at him, muttering:

VISIONARY

so small and shining, shining...

bright and cold, the tiny tiny

star, falling, falling, burning...  

He realises.  Holds up his hand (the non-gauntlet hand). 

On one finger, a JEWELLED RING.

Out of the ring, he plucks:

A DIAMOND.  Literally, diamond-shaped.  Only half-an-inch

across, unadorned, simple and shining.

LORD PRESIDENT

Small enough to follow the link.  

And if this were on Earth -

FX: and he THROWS THE DIAMOND up at the IMAGE OF EARTH, it

burns, mid-air, tiny flare of light, gone - !

THE DOCTOR sits alone, on the steps.  Fiddling with an old

junction box, ordinary wires & stuff, which he's pulled

out of the wall.  Barely looking at it; dark thoughts.

Then he looks up.  Alert.  Stands.  Sensing...

FX: HIS POV, the window; far out in space, the tiny streak

of FIRE, heading down to Earth.  Towards Britain.

The Doctor leans against the glass.  Disturbed.

JUMP CUT TO GUARD-MASTER, unvisored, edging down the side

of the crater with a torch.  Other NS Guard-Masters

silhouetted in b/g, in the light of the jeep's headlights. 

Closer...

At the heart of the crater, the tiny DIAMOND.

The Guard-Master picks it up, carefully.  On radio:

GUARD-MASTER

It's a diamond, sir.

Ohh, the most impossible diamond. 

You won't believe this.

Brilliant.  Closer and closer; then he starts to laugh.

At the far end - a shadow, rushing past, gone. 

WILF (CONT'D)

Is that you..?

He hurries along.

At the end, another stretch of corridor.  Empty.  Wilf a

little afraid, spooked by this whole place.

WILF (CONT'D)

Anyone?  I think I'm lost.

WOMAN

And yet you are found.

He turns round - !

The WOMAN standing right behind him.

WILF (CONT'D)

But what am I supposed to do?

WOMAN

This is the Doctor's final battle. 

At the end of his life, he must

stand at arms.  Or lose himself

and all this world, to the End of

Time.

WILF

But he never carries guns, he

doesn't do that, he's...

(pause)

Who are you?

WOMAN

I was lost.  So very long ago.

Wilf upset, glances down at the gun, looks up again -

She's gone.

WILF comes in.

WILF

Aye aye.  Got this old tub mended?

THE DOCTOR

Just trying to fix the heating.

Wilf sits near him.  Looks out.

FX: THE VIEW OF THE EARTH below.

WILF

Always dreamt of a view like this. 

I'm an astronaut!  It's dawn over

England, look.  Brand new day.

(pause)

My wife's buried down there.  I

might never visit her again, now.

(pause)

D'you think he changed them?  In

Pause.  Then, of the view, indicating the Mediterranean:

WILF

1948, I was over there.  End of

the Mandate in Palestine.  Private

Mott!  Skinny little idiot, I was. 

Stood on this rooftop, middle of a

skirmish, like a blizzard, all

these bullets in the air.  World

gone mad.  

(smiles)

Ah, you don't want to listen to an

old man's tales.

THE DOCTOR

I'm older than you.

WILF

Get away.

THE DOCTOR

I'm nine hundred and six.

WILF

Really, though?

THE DOCTOR

Yep.

WILF

Nine hundred years.  We must look

like insects to you.

THE DOCTOR

I think you look like giants.

And Wilf gets out the service revolver.

WILF

I want you to have this.  Kept it

all this time.  I thought...

THE DOCTOR

No.

No.

I'd be proud.

WILF

Of what?

THE DOCTOR

If you were my dad.

WILF

Oh now, don't start.

The Doctor laughs, a little.  But Wilfred's struggling,

still holding the gun.

WILF (CONT'D)

But you said... you were told, he

will knock four times.  And then

you die.  That's him, isn't it,

the Master?  The noise in his head? 

The Master is going to kill you.

THE DOCTOR

Yeah.

WILF

Then kill him first.

Silence.

WILF (CONT'D)

Don't you deserve it? 

THE DOCTOR

Ohh yeah.  Isn't that the truth? 

Got it in one!  I deserve it,

absolutely!  I so deserve to live. 

Everything I've done, the lives

I've saved, the people, the planets,

every single star in the sky.  So

where is it, then?  Just once. 

Where's the reward?

I think a Time Lord lives too long.

I can't.  I just can't.

WILF

If the Master dies...  What happens

THE DOCTOR

WILF

THE DOCTOR

The template snaps.

WILF

They go back to being Human?

The Doctor just nods.

WILF (CONT'D)

They'll be alive?  And Human? 

Then don't you dare, sir.  Don't

you dare put him before them!

You take it, Doctor.  That's an

order.  Take this gun.

(more upset)

And save your life.  Please don't

die.  You're the most wonderful

man.  I don't want you to die.

Both staring.  Both tearful.  Wilf takes the Doctor's hand. 

Lifts it to the gun.  The Doctor's hand, and Wilf's, on

the cold metal, together.  Like an act of faith.

And then:

THE DOCTOR

Never.

He gently pushes the gun back to Wilf.  And lets go.

And then, all silky and sinister:

ONLINE FX: TWO TECHNICIAN-MASTERS are working on a computer

bank right at the back of the room - ie, directly opposite,

the computer, wires trailing out, a pulsing space of PRAC

Doctor, what does he mean?

A Whitepoint Star is only found on

one planet.  Gallifrey.  Which

means...  It's the Time Lords. 

The Time Lords are returning.

WILF

mean, that's your people!

The Doctor looks at Wilf, almost puzzled, like he's a

stranger, like he's irrelevant, like he's nothing. 

Then looks at Wilf's hand. 

At the gun.

Holds it up.  Stares at it.

covering their faces, a ritual gesture of shame.  Behind

them, in a line, two other TIME LORDS from the table (but

not the Visionary) the CHANCELLOR just joining the back

line, to make three, all now in ceremonial collars.

LORD PRESIDENT

The vote is taken.  Only two stand

against.  And will stand as monument

to their shame, like the Weeping

Angels of old.

Now he walks to stand in front of the two Weeping Time

Lords, facing front, so he's the apex of the triangle.

LORD PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

Now the vanguard stands prepared.  

As the children of Gallifrey return

to the universe.  To Earth!

PRAC WHITE LIGHT backlights the triangle, a powerful white

light in the dark.  Growing in strength.

The Time Lords stand tall and proud; begin to DEFOCUS...

Now two-thirds-Gate-Room, at the Master's end, while the

Gate-end-third has dissolved away into a WHITE VOID.  The

GATE has GONE.  Only some objects formerly in the room -

some computer banks, and say, any free-standing busts-onplinths - remain, surreally standing in the white.

And inside the light...

DEFOCUSED TRIANGLE blurs into view.  THE LORD PRESIDENT

and his TIME LORDS, swimming into existence.

The Master can't stay ceremonial.  He starts to laugh. 

Can't help it, wild with joy! 

DEFOCUS resolving, slowly... clearer and clearer...

Lifts up a BIG HATCH!  Like a trapdoor, in the floor -

The Doctor has landed right in the centre, directly between

the Master and the Lord President, standing either end.

But he's broken.

Lifts himself up, dazed.  Cuts and bruises on his face;

his suit torn.

He tries to hold up the gun.

But he can't.  He's shattered.  Trying so hard.  Head

swimming, lifting himself up on his arm...

But failing.

The gun drops.

He remains on the floor, propped up on one arm.  Breathing

hard.  Bleeding.  Defeated.

The Lord President smiles, cold.

LORD PRESIDENT

My Lord Doctor.  My Lord Master. 

We are gathered.  For the end.

It is a fitting paradox, that our

most infamous child.

THE DOCTOR

Ohhhh, he's not saving you!  Don't

Hey, no, hey, that's mine!  Hush!

You weren't there.  In the final

Timelock's broken, then everything's

coming through, not just the Daleks,

but the Skaro Degradations, the

Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare

Child, the Couldhavebeen King with

his Army of Meanwhiles and Neverweres.  The War turned into Hell. 

And that's what you've opened,

right above the Earth.  Hell is

descending.

THE MASTER

My kind of world!

THE DOCTOR

Just listen!!!  Cos even the Time

Lords can't survive that -

LORD PRESIDENT

We will initiate the Final Sanction. 

The End of Time will come.  At my

hand!  The rupture will continue,

until it rips the Time Vortex apart.

THE MASTER

.but that's suicide...

LORD PRESIDENT

We will ascend!  To become creatures

of consciousness alone.  Free from

these bodies, free from time and

cause and effect; while creation

itself ceases to be.

THE DOCTOR

(to the Master)

D'you see, now?  That's what they

were planning.  In the final days

of the War.  I had to stop them.

THE MASTER

Then... take me with you!  Let me

ascend, Lord President.  Into glory!

You are diseased.  Albeit a disease

of our own creation.  No more.

slamming the gun fast, from one hand to the other -

Now aiming at the Master.

Breathing hard.

Lights flashing on the control panel behind Wilf.  And

filtering into the Doctor's consciousness.

Yeah.

And FIERCE RED PRAC LIGHT, fills the LOCKED BOOTH.  Burning. 

The Doctor in agony.  Wracked with pain.

Wilf despairing.

The Doctor looks at him.  Tries to smile.

More pain, worse, he sinks to his knees, yelling out -

Bows his head.  Curled up like a kid, in the red light.

Wilf stepping back, now, so scared.

And then the red light...

Just fades away.

The Doctor looks up.

Still himself.  But his face is hollow now, haunted.

WILF

Hello.

THE DOCTOR

Hi.

WILF

Still with us?

The Doctor standing.  He seems fine, just a bit dislocated. 

Taps one of the controls inside the booth.

THE DOCTOR

System's dead.  I absorbed it all. 

Whole thing's... kaput.

OPEN/LOCKED signs dead.  He tries the door.  It opens.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Now it opens, yeah.

He walks out.

WILF

There we are then.  Safe and sound. 

Mind you!  You're in hell of a

state.  Got some battle scars there.

The Doctor's still bloodied & bruised.  But now, he lifts

his cut, bruised hands, covers his face, rubs his hands

over his face, shivering a little, brrrr.

Takes his hands away.

Blood and bruises gone.

WILF (CONT'D)

But they've...  Your face!  How

did you do that?

The Doctor looks at his hands; now clean again.

THE DOCTOR

It's started.

Wilf just gives a little 'Oh.'  Understanding enough.

He goes to the Doctor.

And they hug.

WIDE SHOT, the two men alone.  Hold on that.

DONNA, unconscious on the settee.  SHAUN at her side,

worried.  SYLVIA approaching, helpless, with a cuppa.

SHAUN

It's no good, she's freezing, how

long was she lying there?  It's

like hypothermia - try them again!

SYLVIA

I did, it's engaged, everyone's

dialling 999, I can't get through.

SHAUN

But we've got to do something! 

We've got to wake her up.  Donna? 

Can you hear me..?

But then Sylvia looks up.  Hearing, far-off...

The engines of the Tardis.

151 EXT. NOBLES' STREET - DAY 5 151

SYLVIA stepping out.  For once, delighted to see -

THE TARDIS.  A good distance away, down the street.  THE

DOCTOR & WILF standing outside it, the Doctor now in an

clean, undamaged brown suit.  Sylvia waves; thank you.

CUT TO the Doctor & Wilf, the Doctor more his old self.

THE DOCTOR

Oh, she's smiling.  As if today

wasn't bad enough.  Anyway!  Don't

go thinking this is goodbye!  I'll

see you, Wilf.  One more time.

WILF

What d'you mean, when's that?

THE DOCTOR

Just keep looking.  And I'll be

there.

WILF

But where are you going?

MICKEY SMITH!  With a gun & backpack.

MICKEY

I told you to stay behind!

MARTHA

Looks like you need help.  Besides,

you're the one who persuaded me to

go freelance.

MICKEY

Yeah, but we're getting fired at! 

By a Sontaran!  A dumpling with a

gun!  This is no place for a married

woman!

MARTHA

Well then.  You shouldn't have

married me.

And Martha Smith-Jones moves round, next to Mickey.

CUT TO POV from high-up inside the factory.  SONTARAN POV,

the hairlines of a gun.  Targeting:

Martha & Mickey together, down below.  They're not looking

this way, talking, in hiding, reckoning that the Sontaran

is in a completely different direction.

REVERSE on the Sontaran, with his gun.  COMMANDER JASK.

He readies his weapon.

Rifle POV.  Target zooming in on Martha. 

Her forehead.

Jask licking his lips.  About to fire...

Bonk!

Jask blinks.  Then falls down out of frame, unconscious.

Behind him, THE DOCTOR.  With a mallet.

CUT BACK TO Mickey and Martha, consulting a blueprint.

MICKEY

Far above, full-length, the Doctor is looking down at them.

Hold the moment.  They look at him.  He looks at them.

Then the Doctor walks back into darkness, gone.

They stay staring up.  The noise of the Tardis fills the

air.  And somehow, they just know he was saying goodbye.

MICKEY

Hey.

Pulling Martha to him.  Together.  Both so sad.

Mr Smith to put out this story,

saying that wi-fi went mad, all

Everyone with a different face!

He's laughing away, crossing the road - not looking -

Luke foreground, A CAR SPEEDING TOWARDS HIM -

The car zooms past.  And Luke, shaken, finds himself staring

LUKE (CONT'D)

But it's you!  You're..!

Looks at her.  Gives a single wave.  Then steps inside.

On Sarah Jane & Luke; sound of the Tardis fills the air.

And Sarah Jane is crying. 

Because she knows.

CUT TO:

154 INT. ALIEN BAR - NIGHT 8 154

CAPTAIN JACK HARKNESS sits all alone, at the bar.  Deep in

thought.  He's lost so much, and found nothing.

Around him, incredible life, in a dark, downtown drinking

hole in Zaggit Zagoo, capital of Zog.  Aliens galore!  TWO

SLITHEEN.  Some HATH.  A masked SYCORAX.  A GRASKE.  JUDOON. 

Unnameable THINGS.  The rest filled with MONK & NUN extras.         

FX: an ADIPOSE waddles past Jack, on the counter, mewling.

Then the barman slides a piece of paper over to Jack.

BARMAN

From the man over there.

Jack's puzzled.  Looks up. 

Far across the bar, THE DOCTOR.  Just standing there.

Jack smiles, a little, but stays where he is.  Knows

something's different.  Holds up the paper, what's this?

The Doctor just nods, open it.

Jack does so.

A handwritten note, saying:

His name is Alonso.

Jack looks up again.

The Doctor nods, to his left.

The man sitting next to Jack, also on his own, turns around. 

It's MIDSHIPMAN FRAME.

Jack smiles at the Doctor.  Gives him a salute.  Farewell.

155 INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY 9 155

A Waterstone's-type shop.  A queue of PEOPLE, for a booksigning.  Advertising for the book on display, a blown-up

cover: A Journal of Impossible Things, by Verity Newman.

The queue leading to VERITY, sitting at a table, a stack

of books next to her.  She is the image of Joan Redfern

(eps 3.8 & 9).  Chatting to a customer, as she signs.

VERITY

it's not just a story, every...

word of it is true.  I found my

great grandmother's diary in the

loft.  And she was a nurse, in

1913, and she fell in love with

this man, called John Smith.  Except

he was a visitor.  From another

world.  She fell in love with a

man from the stars.  And she wrote

it all down.

Customer moves off, next one moves in foreground - she

automatically takes the book, doesn't look up.

VERITY (CONT'D)

And who's it for?

MAN

The Doctor.

VERITY

To... the Doctor...

Funny, that was the name he used.

And she's breathless.

She knows.  She just knows.

The Doctor so grave.  So kind.

Hold the stare, the silence.  She can't help it, she starts

to cry, just a little.  And then:

THE DOCTOR

Was she happy?  In the end?

VERITY

Yes.  Yes she was.

Hold the silence.

VERITY (CONT'D)

Were you?

He gives a small smile.  Takes the book.  Walks away.

She's never been so happy.  The biggest smile!

JUMP CUT to Donna & Shaun, lining up for photos -

DONNA

photo's just with friends, I want

all of you in, that's it.  And

you!  Friends, and Nerys.

Only joking!  Look at her!

NERYS

You made me wear peach.

Wilf looks.

Far away, outside the church: THE DOCTOR, and the TARDIS.

JUMP CUT TO Wilf & Sylvia, hurrying up to the Doctor.

WILF

There now, same old face.  Didn't

I say you'd be all right?  Oh! 

And they arrested Mr Naismith!  It

was on the news.  Crimes

undisclosed!  And his daughter. 

Both of 'em, locked up! 

(pause)

But I keep thinking, Doctor... 

There's one thing you never told

me.  That woman.  Who was she?

The Doctor just looks.  At Wilf.  At Sylvia.  At Donna, in

the distance.  Friends, mothers, brides. 

He's not saying.

THE DOCTOR

Just wanted to give you this.

He hands Wilf an envelope.

THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)

Wedding present.  Thing is, I never

carry money.  So I just popped

back in time, borrowed a quid off

a really lovely man.  Geoffrey

Noble, his name was.  Have it, he

said.  Have that on me.

On Wilf and Sylvia.  Overwhelmed.

JUMP CUT TO Wilf, a little shaken, back inside the

churchyard with Donna & guests, handing her the envelope -

Snow.  Falling through the air.  Against black.

Coming down to find the ground-floor courtyard, covered in

No one around except a girl and her mother, walking along

together.  ROSE TYLER, and JACKIE.  Niggling!

ROSE

I'm late now, I missed it, it's

midnight.  Mickey's gonna be calling

JACKIE

It's not, it's Jimbo, he said he'd

give us a lift, then he said his

axle broke, I can't help it!

Get rid of him, mum, he's useless.

Listen to you!  With a mechanic! 

Be fair though, my time of life,

I'm not gonna do much better.

And Rose walks on, alone.

A good distance away, watching, from the shadows.  THE

DOCTOR.  Silent.  In the snow.  His face in darkness.

She doesn't even see him, just walking on by...

But then he winces.  Pain.  Can't help gasping, ow!

She stops.  Looks across.  A bit wary, keeps her distance.

ROSE

You all right, mate?

THE DOCTOR

Yeah.

ROSE

Too much to drink?

THE DOCTOR

Something like that.

ROSE

Maybe it's time you went home.

THE DOCTOR

Yeah.

Pause.

Anyway.  Happy new year.

In the distance: the TARDIS.

As he walks, he loses the pretence.  He's in so much pain. 

Dragging his feet.  Every step.

He winces, sharp pain, ow!

Tries to keep going.  The longest walk.

Walking through the snow.

Then it really hits him.  Agony.  He falls to his knees. 

desperate.  And so alone.

He heaves for breath.  Can't find the strength.

He could die, right here.

But then...

A song.

A familiar song.  Drifting in through the night.

The Song of the Ood.

The Doctor looks up.

Standing far away, in the snow.  OOD SIGMA.

The song is rising, now, soaring.

The Doctor gaining strength from it.

OOD SIGMA

We will sing to you, Doctor.  The
