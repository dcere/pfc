  <h1>Appscale Tools Error</h1>
  <%= content_tag :h3, display_flash_messages %>
  <p>
    In order to upload an application via the web interface you must have AppScale tools (same version as your deployed AppScale). The latest version of the tools can be downloaded from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/appscale/">AppScale Wiki</a></p>

  <p>Once installed the path to tools can be set via the TOOLS_PATH environment variable or in "<em>AppLoadBalancer/config/environment.rb</em>". By default the path is set to "<em>/usr/local/appscale-tools</em>". Currently the path is set to "<em><%=h TOOLS_PATH %></em>" but this directory either does not exist or does not contain a bin directory with the require executables.
  </p>
  <p>After the path has been modified the load balancer must be restarted. This can be done by running "god stop mongrels" and then "god start mongrels".
  </p>
