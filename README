Master thesis - Proyecto fin de carrera (PFC)


Description
-----------
A Puppet extension to manage cloud resources. The main goal is to manage clouds
as another Puppet resource. This is achieved creating new types and providers.
To avoid code duplicity among providers a general Cloud (Ruby) class is offered.

The core of the project is in the '/dev/puppet' directory.
The 'adm' directory contains administration files.
the 'doc' directory contains documentation files.
